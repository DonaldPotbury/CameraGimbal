# Camera-Gimbal
 
# Description:
My church had a need for a device to remotely pan and tilt a hand held television camera.  Later the ability zoom and focus was added to the focus.  This repository describes the electronics and software used for the project.   RemoteXY was used for the GUI.

### Hardware:
- (1) ESP8266 NodeMCU Development board.
